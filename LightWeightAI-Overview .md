LightWeightAI supports the following device types:

-   **Mini-System Devices \(reference memory ≥ 128 KB\)**

    Such devices are equipped with MCU processors such as ARM Cortex-M and 32-bit RISC-V. They provide robust short-distance connection and peripheral bus access capabilities. Typical products include LinkIoT module devices and smart home sensors. The LinkIoT module is usually used as a hardware module that provides connectivity for smart Internet of Things \(IoT\) devices. In the smart home field, the LinkIoT module is integrated into devices by vendors. For example, a LinkIoT module provides WLAN/Bluetooth access and data connection, and it usually communicates with the chip of smart home devices via a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter \(UART\) or general-purpose input/output \(GPIO\) interface.

-   **Small-System Devices \(reference memory ≥ 1 MB\)**

    Such devices are equipped with application processors such as ARM Cortex-A. They provide improved security, a standard graphics framework, and multimedia capabilities for video encoding and decoding. Typical products include smart home IP cameras, electronic cat eyes, and routers, and event data recorders \(EDRs\) for smart travel.


-   **Standard-System Devices \(reference memory ≥ 128 MB\)**

    Such devices are equipped with application processors such as ARM Cortex-A. They provide a complete application framework supporting enhanced interaction, 3D GPU, hardware composer, a diverse range of components and visual displays, for example the type included on a high-end refrigerator.

-   **Large-System Devices \(reference memory ≥ 1 GB\)**

    Such devices are equipped with application processors such as ARM Cortex-A and provide a complete compatible application framework. Typical products include smart TVs and smart watches.
